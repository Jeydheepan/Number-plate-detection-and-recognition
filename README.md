<h3>This project deals with two modules:<br><br/></h3>
  Identifying the number plate from the vehicle<br><br/>
  Recognizing the numbers in the number plate<br><br/>
  
 <h3>Grid 1</h3> I have found the number plate in the Vehicle<br><br/>
 <h3>Grid 2</h3> I have used KNN Character recogintion (i.e.) KNN Machine Learning Algorithm to identify the characters<br><br/>
 <h3>Grid 3</h3> I have implemented OCR tesseract for Character Recognition<br><br/>
 <h3>Grid 4</h3> The final module All the modules are gathered and the final model is obtained with a better accuracy<br><br/>
